## <span style="color:#4974a5;">Agenda</span>

### <span style="color:#4974a5;">1. Introduction</span>

-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Objective</span>**: Define the goals of your analysis. What questions are you trying to answer or what insights are you looking for?
-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Dataset Overview</span>**: Brief description of the dataset, including its size, columns, and general contents.

###  <span style="color:#4974a5;">2. Data Preparation </span>

-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Load the Data</span>**: Use read.csv() or other functions to load your dataset into R.

-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Inspect the Data</span>**: Use functions like head(), str(), and summary() to understand the structure and contents of the dataset.

-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Handle Missing Values</span>**: Identify and address missing values using methods like imputation or removal.

-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Convert Data Types</span>**: Ensure that all columns have the correct data types (e.g., factors, dates).

-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Feature Engineering</span>**: Create new variables if needed (e.g., binning continuous variables).

###  <span style="color:#4974a5;">3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</span>

-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Descriptive Statistics</span>**: Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Data Visualization</span>**:
    -   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Univariate Analysis</span>**: Create histograms, bar plots, and box plots to understand the distribution of individual variables.
    -   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Bivariate Analysis</span>**: Use scatter plots, line charts, and correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables.
-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Distribution Analysis</span>**: Check the distribution of key variables and look for any anomalies.

###  <span style="color:#4974a5;">4. Data Analysis</span>

-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Group Analysis</span>**: Aggregate and summarize data based on categorical variables (e.g., total cancellations by country or market segment).
-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Trend Analysis</span>**: Analyze trends over time if applicable (e.g., cancellation rates by month or year).
-   **<span style="color:#4974a5;">Comparison Analysis</span>**: Compare different groups or categories to identify patterns or significant differences.

### <span style="color:#4974a5;">Conclusion for the Hotel Bookings Data Analysis</span>

### <span style="color:#4974a5;"> After performing a detailed analysis of the hotel bookings dataset, the following key insights have emerged</span>

### <span style="color:#4974a5;"> Cancellation Patterns</span>

A significant portion of bookings were canceled, highlighting a potential issue with booking reliability. Understanding the reasons behind cancellations (e.g., long lead times or booking policies) could help in mitigating future cancellations.
The cancellation rate fluctuates across different years, with certain years showing a higher tendency for cancellations. This trend may be influenced by external factors such as economic conditions or travel restrictions.

### <span style="color:#4974a5;">Lead Time Impact </span>

Bookings with longer lead times (more days between booking and arrival) have a higher likelihood of being canceled. The majority of cancellations happen when the lead time is beyond 100 days. This suggests that people who book further in advance are more likely to cancel.
Conversely, bookings with shorter lead times (e.g., less than 50 days) show fewer cancellations, indicating that last-minute bookings tend to be more reliable.

### <span style="color:#4974a5;"> Seasonality of Cancellations</span>

The month of arrival has a noticeable impact on cancellation rates. Certain months, particularly the peak vacation seasons (e.g., July and August), show higher cancellation rates. This could be due to overbooking or fluctuating vacation plans.
Hotels might benefit from implementing more flexible booking or cancellation policies during these high-cancellation periods to reduce booking loss.

### <span style="color:#4974a5;"> Impact of Hotel Type</span>

Resort hotels experience higher lead times and slightly higher cancellation rates compared to city hotels. This is likely because resort bookings are made well in advance for holidays or special events, which are more prone to cancellation as plans change.
City hotels tend to attract more last-minute bookings, leading to lower cancellation rates and quicker turnover of rooms.

### <span style="color:#4974a5;">Yearly Booking Trends </span>

The number of bookings has grown consistently over the years, indicating increasing popularity or market demand for these hotels.
Despite this growth, the proportion of cancellations has remained relatively stable, suggesting that the hotels are maintaining a balance between their booking and cancellation rates over time.

## <span style="color:#4974a5;">Recommendations </span>

### <span style="color:#4974a5;"> Cancellation Policy Adjustments</span> 

Consider offering incentives for early bookings with shorter lead times or penalties for cancellations closer to the booking date. Flexible booking options could help reduce cancellations while maintaining customer satisfaction.
Marketing Strategies: Target customers who tend to make last-minute bookings, especially during off-peak months, to improve occupancy rates and reduce reliance on bookings with long lead times.

### <span style="color:#4974a5;">Seasonal Preparations </span> 

Be proactive in adjusting pricing and availability during high-cancellation periods such as summer holidays. Overbooking strategies or stricter cancellation policies may be necessary during these months to avoid revenue loss.
